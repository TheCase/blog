Certainly not the first introduction of tech to the wife’s garden, but first application of 3D printing.

Saw this clever idea on Thingiverse: [http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6685](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6685)

Theory is that the white (cabbage) butterflies are too polite to tread on another’s turf, so they stay away if someone else is “laying eggs” in a certain area.

I scaled them down a bit from the original. I saved some filament making them thinner and hot gluing sprinkler marker flags (minus flag) to them for stakes. Also moved the dot to where our local species seem to have them (if I remember correctly).

The hope is that we humans are the only ones that are munching on our veg.

Hopefully I’ll see some (non) results in the next few weeks!
