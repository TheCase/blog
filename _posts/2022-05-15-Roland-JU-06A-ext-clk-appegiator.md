A major miss by Roland on the JU-06a Boutique - the external clock sync does not trigger held notes when the arpeggio function is enabled. 

I wrote Roland about it, and here is their response (ie. We can complain all we want but they probably won't fix it):

Hello,

Thank you fr contacting Roland Support.

Unfortunately the JU-06A is not compatible with arpeggiating gate with the "EXT CLK IN" port. 
This is a much requested feature - Please understand that Roland has been actively engaged in research and development in diversified scientific & business areas for many years. While we value and appreciate feedback from users, our role in customer support is limited to inquiries regarding product operation only.
 
Thank you for your understanding, have a wonderful day!

##Workaround

There is a workaround, however. Enter your desired notes into the sequencer and hold down Edit, hit the 5 button and adjust the sequence length to the number of notes in your sequence. 

###Shortcomings

- Limited to 16 notes. 
- no up/down pattern
- no octave jump additions

However you might be able to stumble up some unique patterns in combination with different step order types.
