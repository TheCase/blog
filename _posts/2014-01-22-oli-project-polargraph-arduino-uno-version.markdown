I was recently reminded it would be nice see a write up of my experience of building a Polargraph that is controlled via a Ardunio Uno.

The kit from polargraph.co.uk is wonderful, but for a few reasons I decided to skip the kit and do the DIY thing:  
 1) I can print my own parts  
 2) I already had an Uno laying around  
 3) I’m generally a cheapskate and I decided I could source less expensive parts

Parts list:  
[Arduino Uno](http://amzn.to/1Qn7Uw8)  
[motor shield](http://amzn.to/1KD5MBN)  
[2x NEMA 17 Stepper motors](http://www.adafruit.com/products/324)  
 one (1) 9g servo  
 fishing line (had this on hand – I figure anything over 10lb test would work)  
 wood board for printing surface (MDF recommended something at least 2’x2′ should work fine for 8.5×11 paper prints)  
 sharpie pen

3D printed parts:  
 Arduino clip – this was fortunate to find, as the board I had on hand was 3/4″ thick MDF) http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:17882  
 quick change pen holder [http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:28854](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:28854)  
 2x fishing line spools [http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16384](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16384)  
 2x motor mounts [http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:288271](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:288271)
