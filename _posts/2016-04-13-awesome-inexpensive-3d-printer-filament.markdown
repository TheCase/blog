I stocked up on a bunch of filament a couple years ago, but my stock is starting to run out.  In the past I’ve mainly used plastic from Ultimachine and Faberdashery – but its gotten quite expensive ($20.00 a lb) and shipping is not cheap.

So I asked a good friend what he’s been buying lately.  He’s quite happy with the filament from [Hatchbox](http://amzn.to/23F9v7z). Its almost half the price of the other guys, comes on a spool and is available via [Amazon Prime](http://amzn.to/23F9v7z)!
