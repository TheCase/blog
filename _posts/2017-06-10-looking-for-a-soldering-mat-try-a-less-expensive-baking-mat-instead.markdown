I was searching for a soldering mat for my new work surface in my new basement’s office.  I was not happy with the available sizes (and prices) for larger, branded silicone rubber [soldering mats](http://amzn.to/2seVLaC).

In one of my searches, I came across [several larger baking mats](http://amzn.to/2rheMEm) that are considerably less expensive – and they come in some cool colors too!

I ended up with [this one](http://amzn.to/2rdhcZh)…  massive at 23.4″ x 15.6″ and very cool in orange!  Bonus: it comes with some handy kitchen tools too!

I’ll have to update this post with pictures once it arrives and is in its place in my office/lab.
