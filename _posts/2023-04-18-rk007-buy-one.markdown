<hr>

This is an Arduino Pro Micro version of the device. I beefed up the 3D-printed case from 1mm->3mm wall thickness.

TRS MIDI Cable is included with your purchase

#### Items of note

"TRS" stands for Tip, Ring, Sleeve. When shopping for a TRS->MIDI 5-DIN cable, you are looking for a "Type A" version.  Type A has the following pinout:

- Tip -> DIN Pin 5 (Data Reference) - TXD from Arduino 
- Ring -> DIN Pin 4 (Voltage Reference) - VCC from Arduino
- Sleeve -> DIN Pin 2 (Shield) - GND from Arduino

#### Need help?
