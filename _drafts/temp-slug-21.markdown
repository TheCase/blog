title: 'OLI Project: Mini POV Quad'

I brought the parts in for one of my to-do-someday projects, and others wanted me to post about it.

The genesis for it is that I’m still kinda uncomfortable flying a $1200 investment around while I’m still mastering this quad piloting thing. I stumbled across this article and had to make it happen:

> [Build a micro-sized first-person-view quadcopter](https://boingboing.net/2014/06/20/build-a-micro-sized-first-pers.html)

<iframe class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9dzrsd2Spx" frameborder="0" height="338" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" sandbox="allow-scripts" scrolling="no" security="restricted" src="https://boingboing.net/2014/06/20/build-a-micro-sized-first-pers.html/embed#?secret=9dzrsd2Spx" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="“Build a micro-sized first-person-view quadcopter” — Boing Boing" width="600"></iframe>

Now… I don’t think I exactly trust the wiring/voltage that is outlined there. I did some more searching and found this, which uses a diode to cut the quad’s 3.7v power down to a 3.3v that should be safer for the transmitter. I also like the idea of the noise reduction caps:

I used the instructions here to build my cloverleaf antenna:

I’d probably also pick up some extra batteries and a smarter charger while you’re shopping there:
