 Post Case‚Äôs quadcopter

I finally got around to working on the frame today. I looked at various materials for the arms, and found out I would have saved some gasoline if I‚Äôd just went with JimH‚Äôs idea of using towel holder tubing (square). It cuts/drills cleanly and is strong, light and cheap! My entire frame with tubing, carbon fiber mount plates and hardware weighed in at 185g.

I did have one error that needed to be corrected: initially I placed the motor mounts too far apart, and there wasn‚Äôt enough slack in the ESC cabling to reach the control board terminals. Simply rotated the mounts inward and drilled a couple more holes. Easy fix, thankfully.

Thanks HobbyKing, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve invested more than $350 to achieve a manual flier.

If I can work out the power terminals, I should be able to test liftoff later this evening! Looking good, IMH*O for a cheap, simple, custom frame.

What‚Äôs left:  
 fabricate power terminals to connect batteries to the ESCs  
 mount KK control board  
 attach props

 oh ‚Äì forgot about this, but I took a pic of the ESC power distribution terminal I cooked up ‚Äì as I thought some might be interested in the design. Yes, totally stole the idea from HobbyKing, but I didn‚Äôt have to wait two weeks and pay $20 to ship a $4 part!

 I soldered each half side of a ‚Äúbullet‚Äù connector down to copper.

http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/stor ‚Ä¶ duct=10255

This build is pretty old school. No printed parts (gasp!), no CNC. All of the fab work was either dremel or drill press. Never worked with carbon fiber sheet before. Nifty stuff.

First flight test is tomorrow. We‚Äôll how well a stock firmware flash on the KK controller holds up. Literally.

 I wouldn‚Äôt go for a first flight over concrete! Do it above the grass! At least if you crash it won‚Äôt hurt quite as bad.

Looking forward to seeing it in action.

 Yes, I have moved to grass. I had to mow it first though!

The flip was cosmetic damage. A couple scuffs on a prop.

I‚Äôm certainly running into a calibration issue on the KK clone board in getting the ESC/throttle stuff to even up between motors. The two left side motors are pushing harder than the right side, causing the pancake flip. Docs are sketchy, numerous and in poor english.

 You should tether it to the ground so it can only rise a couple inches until you get the rough calibration done.

 I made the mistake of tethering the quad with my hands. I think if you use stakes and strong lanyards you should be fine. And make then short. Don‚Äôt have enough slack that they will get pulled up into the blades for whatever reason. üôÇ

 Post Re: Case‚Äôs quadcopter  
 !!UPDATE!!

So other than the small error I made with battery wiring (fried a couple lipo cells, long story, ask me next time you see me), I‚Äôve been struggling with some firmware issues on the KK board and the 4.7 firmware: a common problem is that motor #4 doesn‚Äôt seem to start spinning until around 80% throttle, where the other three kick right off on the first throttle touch.

The required connectors I needed for proper battery wiring (in-flight, as well as charging) arrived today, so I was able to apply power to the motors once again, for more tests. My non-prop dry runs tonight showed that I might be able to overcome the ‚Äúlazy‚Äù motor issue if I use some slight manual flight stick corrections during takeoff.

Alas, it is too late to try a wet test at the moment‚Ä¶ too many obstacles in the garage! Must wait until tomorrow.

Nope. Calibration ruled out. Swap any other position‚Äôs ESC/motor with number 4 and it‚Äôs the same. And vice versa. It‚Äôs a firmware issue that was not present in previous versions. (don‚Äôt have the extensive forum discussion link handy ATM)

The firmware author seems adiment about the fact the #4 motor will operate normally once the gyros have the opportunity to sense things from the air instead of the ground.

One experiment I tried was reversing the yaw in the stock firmware, and I think it will give me enough manual joystick control in a direction that will spin all motors equally for a even liftoff.

 It FLEW!

Sorta. I got it about a foot off the ground, but the hover is terrible ‚Äì like two opposing motors (2 and 3) are fighting for control. Perhaps the craft is unbalanced. And now I have to recharge the cells before the next test.

Back to the drawing board‚Ä¶ but much progress! I only chopped up a few of the wife‚Äôs plants during uncontrolled landings

 ok. getting better after fiddling with pots on the control board. its very close to acting like a real copter.

Yes, I‚Äôm having enough trouble controlling the thing, let alone trying to film it. I think Liz fears injury in being with 50 feet of the thing, so she‚Äôs no help!

 Post Re: Case‚Äôs quadcopter  
 More updates. Finally got my next batch of crap from HobbyKing (note: DO NOT pay for express shipping ‚Äì even though my first order arrived within 5 days, this second express order took nearly a month) after being out of town for a couple weeks.

Which means the USB cable for the transmitter arrived, and I was finally able to tweak on the trim settings beyond stock. I actually had the thing hovering about 10 feet above my head today and it was flying pretty smooth.

While the batteries were charging, I came up with some better struts (the long 6/32 bolts had seen enough bending): http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:28038

After that, I was able to fly it for a while before the dust storm gust threw the quad to the ground ‚Äì thankfully the new struts break away easily and absorbed most of the impact. Finally broke my first blade as well. Back to the printer!

I also added a CD cake box helmet to protect to brains.

I wanted to get some video to show off, but maintenance time cancelled those plans and now it is dark outside. Perhaps tomorrow. Or maybe I need more LEDs!

Here‚Äôs the full view of the current state of the project:

 After some initial successful testing of the frame and the cheapo KK flight board as a proof of concept, it was a green light for adding on the big toys. Both arrived today. And they are both (sort of) featured in one photograph!

First off, we‚Äôre viewing Mission Planner running on the laptop with comms via wireless telemetry via my quad with its shiny new Ardupilot board (note the GPS has a fix!). And the wonderful 170 degree POV pic was taken with the new GoPro camera.

The intial electronics test went well ‚Äì everything looks to be in order. It‚Äôs late, but I hope to get the new board mounted to the frame so I can start flight testing tomorrow!

I‚Äôll probably want to make sure she isn‚Äôt doing backflips first, then I work out the camera mount.

(yes, I‚Äôm just a little excited).

 Post Re: Case‚Äôs quadcopter  
 I was hovering (see what I did there?) at about $250 for the KK board, motors, ESC‚Äôs, batteries, chargers, frame materials, props and tx/rx system. The arudpilot doubled and then the GoPro tripled it.

Oh‚Ä¶ and if someone‚Äôs looking towards my build for a BOM‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd recommend we sit down and re-evaluate based on my discoveries‚Ä¶ in retrospect, I‚Äôd start again differently. But everything is a learning process and I‚Äôm glad I just bit the bullet and started where I did.

 Post Re: Case‚Äôs quadcopter : back to the drawing board  
 So I‚Äôve decided I need to start over with my motor/ESC/prop combination.

Why? The craft pitches back hard and rolls to the right at takeoff ‚Äì and its way beyond the transmitter trim settings to get it to level.

First, I thought my hacked together frame and its alignment could be causing the motors to pull unevenly. So I redesigned and printed new frame parts. And it didn‚Äôt solve the issue. I think my current motor RPM is way too high for a copter of this size. I also noticed that it becomes less of an issue when the battery starts to get low ‚Äì so that‚Äôs why I suspect high RPM‚Äôs to be the issue.

Current config: 1500rpmV outrunners with 15A ESCs and 8X4.5 props

And so I placed an order for new stuff, and am prepared to wait another month for the stuff to arrive from HongKong.

New config: 860rpmV outrunners, 25A ESCs and 10√ó4.7 props

I‚Äôm hoping this will give me a much more stable flight. I plugged the values into the multicopter calculator and it looks good.

In the meantime, here are some pics of the new frame parts I designed:

 Nice looking parts! Are the motors not able to slow down enough to work, or are the RPMs fairly fixed in rate?

 Post Re: Case‚Äôs quadcopter  
 I suppose that RPM is not specifically the correct term. The rpm/V figure is set, yes. The higher that value is: more speed per volt applied, but less torque comes along with that higher value.

I think (while I‚Äôm waiting for the new parts) I‚Äôll try to reduce the battery weight and shorten the motor arms ‚Äì maybe that will help. I‚Äôll get less flight time, but if it works I might just end up with an acrobat in addition to the camera rig I originally set out for üôÇ

 Post Re: Case‚Äôs quadcopter  
 For 3D planes (planes that you try to hover like helicopters) the usual RPM/V is 1000 (using a 7.4v or 11.1v battery), using a 1047 or 1038 prop (or 0947 0938). Also, I would try using slow-fly props instead.

 Those 9 and 10 inch props are way too big for the 1500s.

Yes, I‚Äôm using slow-fly props.

I could probably try 7.4v batteries as well.

9‚Ä≥ props are generally considered the bottom end on diameter for ‚Äúnormal‚Äù (40cm ‚Äì 60cm) size quads. Usually the target is between 800 ‚Äì 1000 Kv for the motors on the normal size quads.

3S or 4S is the common voltage for packs. Looking at the pictures, it looks like you are running 2S. I have a bunch of 3S packs if you want to borrow one to try out (assuming your motor is rated for it).

If the motor can handle the 3S pack, I‚Äôd try going up to a 9‚Ä≥ or even 10‚Ä≥ prop with a 3S battery.

 I think (while I‚Äôm waiting for the new parts) I‚Äôll try to reduce the battery weight and shorten the motor arms ‚Äì maybe that will help. I‚Äôll get less flight time, but if it works I might just end up with an acrobat in addition to the camera rig I originally set out for üôÇ

If you are looking for a photo platform, you actually will want to go bigger. 45cm, and smaller, rigs are the acrobats of the Quad world, and photo ships are usually closer to the 50cm ‚Äì 75cm range.

 New config: 860rpmV outrunners, 25A ESCs and 10√ó4.7 props

This sounds like a much better config to me.

 OK, so while I‚Äôm waiting for the ‚Äúlarge‚Äù copter parts to arrive, I redesigned the frame for a second, smaller quad: 12‚Ä≥ between the 1500rpmV motors. 8√ó4‚Ä≥ props. (back to the KK board as well).

I also got some 7.4v lipo packs, and the whole thing is much more stable and controllable. I flew continuously for about 3 minutes @~20ft elevation yesterday without having to touch back down because of control issues. Great fun!

Cool! Sounds like you are getting things dialed in good now. Congrats on keeping it aloft for 3 minutes.

Any feel for how much charge you have left after the 3 minutes (what is the voltage down to at the end of the flight)? Don‚Äôt want to over discharge LiPo‚Äôs. They don‚Äôt like it and it can damage them.

Of course the obligatory taunt of ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the video or it didn‚Äôt happen‚Äù has to be thrown in! üòâ üòâ ![:mrgreen:](https://i2.wp.com/blog.repulsor.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/mrgreen.png?w=840&ssl=1)

yeah yeah. My GoPro is out for RMA. When it gets back (and hopefully works) I‚Äôll strap that sucker on my head just to double my dorktasticness. Maybe the motors for the large quad will show up ‚Äì then I can video the small quad from it! Quadruple dorktasticness?! Or are we approaching a full depth dork-ception at that point?

(for the record: I love being that dork)

I‚Äôve got a low voltage alarm on one of the packs. It goes off right around the time the craft starts losing altitude.

 Sorry about the shaky video, but the props are out way of balance (one is cracked) and the camera is a uber-cheap little keychain cam.

Popped a motor! Cheapo thing popped the top right off the casing mid-flight. I was only about 30 feet in the air, and managed to only bust one prop in the crash (hard to tell, but its the far left). Great combo of a small light craft and a grass landing. Since I‚Äôm down to three props, I‚Äôm grounded until I can source more cheap ones‚Ä¶

 Crud! Sorry you grounded for the moment. Looking at the video, I think the motor was loose / failing right from the get go, or that out of balance prop was REALLY out of balance.

Now that I have the printer going, I‚Äôm gonna have to devote some time to Quads again too.

BTW, Lore (Good name for a ‚ÄòBot isn‚Äôt it üòâ ) passed a milestone today. He printed an improved replacement part for himself!

 Silly me, getting all overly complicated with the power distribution on my last go-around.

I didn‚Äôt have a double sided copper circuit board blank, as that would have been a bit more efficient‚Ä¶ so instead I had to use two pieces of board blank, back to back. This method is much easier than splitting a one sided board into a positive and negative rail.

 I‚Äôve always liked the technique that this guy from Hoverfly shows in his tutorial. He shows the power distribution trick about 8 minutes in.

[BBvideo 600,450]http://vimeo.com/20481460[/BBvideo]

The video is part of a whole page of tutorials, that while geared around Hoverfly‚Äôs product (expensive!), are chocked full of good info.

 Its been a while, but I think I‚Äôm about to embark on a slew of updates.

While I‚Äôm waiting for the FPV video goggles, I started testing on the OSD overlay unit:

I have plans to redesign the entire electronics area, as I would like some sort of container to protect the $$$ stuff from damage, should bad things happen (water, forced landings).

More soon.
